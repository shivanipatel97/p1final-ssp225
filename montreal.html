  <p class="first"> About a week before spring break 2017, the close-knit friend group of Tiffany, Caroline, and I made last
    minute plans to drive up to Montreal. Sure it was bound to be as cold, if not colder, than Ithaca, but we
    found a nice and cheap airbnb and were ready to hit the city. </p>
    <h2> ~Food~ </h2>
    <p> First, let us talk about the FOOD!  It was all absolutely amazing. The first night we got the best food I
      have had to date at a beautiful restaurant in Old Montreal.  The meals in general are a pricey, but definitely worth it. </p>

      <p>I recommend that you look up menus of each restaurant before-hand, especially if you have some
        dietary restriction (for example, I'm a vegetarian). </p>

        <p> Along with the fancy French food, be sure to try some crepes for desert then some poutine after a night out!</p>

        <h3> ~Daytime~ </h3>
        <p> Now it's time to talk about some nice city-exploring and site-seeing!  Let me start off by saying that
          you don't absolutely need to know French (all I know is how to say "hello, my name is"),
          but it seems like it would've been extremely hard to enjoy Montreal as much as I did without the help of
          Tiffany and Caroline's French skills. </p>
          <figure>

            <img alt="Caroline and I at Mont Royal" src="images/montreal/montroyal.jpg" width="350" height=475>
          </figure>
          <p>Now while there is an abundance of things to do, I 100% encourage you to hike up Mont Royal and look at
            the breath taking view.  My friends and I got lucky, and some other tourists gave us their parking pass,
            so we saved a few bucks there.</p>
            <figure>
              <!-- Image source: Shivani Patel took both images on her iPhone. -->
              <img alt="Old Montreal" src="images/montreal/old2.jpg" width="475" height=350>
            </figure>
            <p> Now either before or after Mont Royal, you'll have plenty of time to explore a part of the city that,
              along with the language change, will make you feel like you're in Europe: Old Montreal.  One thing that
              was a bit pricey, but also a nice way to pass time in the rain was Bonsecours Market.  They had everything
              from clothes to jewelry to maple syrup.  Once the rain stops though be sure to check out Old Port's view and
              all the neat shops and art galleries nearby! </p>

              </figure>
              <p>Last, but definitely not least, you have to check out Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts in downtown Montreal.
                There is free admission (unless you want access to an exclusive exhibit, but there is more than enough to
                see aside from this) so no excuses! It had such a nice variety of exhibits that there's something for everyone.
                The metro is an easy and cheap way to get around, and you're in luck because there are special weekend passes. </p>
