  <p class="first"> It was the summer before I started college, meaning it was the firsts summer I had no responsibilities whatsoever with high school being over and college yet to happen.
    My sister, and I had just finished a huge performance event as a graduation for our dance school, and we were exhausted and ready for a vacation.
    Little did we realize that our aching bodies would not be getting a rest with this wild trip. </p>

    <h2> ~Rome~ </h2>
    <p> Our first destinaiton was Rome, and I was as tired as could be when we landed.  We had to take a train from the airport to the main part of the city, and from there
      we walked uphill, in the summer heat, to our hotel.  Let me start out by advising on going to Europe anytime other than July.  It was insanely hot and all I wanted was
      to stay in the hotel room for the first few days.  Luckily once my appetite returned I was able to enjoy the amazing pasta, gelato, and panna cotta.
      In order to enjoy all the sites available make sure to bring plenty of water too!  We learned this lesson well when walking around the Colosseum and surround ruins.
      My mom, a neat freak, passed out on the sidewalk and it took us a solid 45 minutes to walk the 15 minutes it normally would've taken to return to the hotel. (Not to worry
      though, she was fine!  We still joke about it to this day.)

      <h3> ~Cinque Terre~ </h3>
      <p>  The plan was to drive to Cinque Terre after Rome. However, after getting to the car rental company an hour after our scheduled time,
        our car had been given away and we had to wait 3 hours for another one.  When we finally were able to get a car to go on our way, we were crazy excited.  My little
        brother, 8 years old at the time, entertained us the entire time.  That is until an hour in when one of our tires popped and we were stuck on an Italian highway with little
        to no knowledge on speaking Italian.  Luckily, wrench signs are universal, and when we finally found one we took the exit and a mechanic's wife helped us out. </p>

        <p> With that we continued on our journey, past ebautiful sunflower fields, to our tiny and hot, but incredibly breathtaking apartment overlooking the water.
          Cinque Terre is composed of 5 coastal villages. One option of traveling between them is to take the train, but of course my family opted to hike from
          land to land.  They were incredibly strenuous in the heat, but I would go back in a heartbeat.  Cinque Terre really loves their pesto
          and it seemed to be the speciality of every restaurant every night.  While there wasn't much variety outside of this for vegetarians, it was made so well the thought
          makes my mouth water. Cinque Terre's fresh fruits, pesto pasta, and unreal views will forever have a piece of my heart. </p>
