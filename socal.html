  <p class="first"> I was so fortunate to land an internship in San Diego this past summer 2017!  I was based aout 35 minutes
    north of San Diego in a suburban area and was able to stay with family, so I saved a ton on rent.  I then
    that money into a rental car instead, which let me drive down to San Diego and up to Los Angeles whichever
    weekend my heart desired. </p>

    <h2> ~Carlsbad~ </h2>
    <p> Let me start off by saying that working full time is <span class="em">exhausting</span>.  This meant I had to save my
      adventures for the weekend.  I was lucky enough to live a short 10 minute drive from the Pacific Ocean
      so whenevr I wanted to relax I'd just drive down then take a stroll.</p>

      <p>If you ever find yourself in Carlsbad Village, be sure to check out Gaia's Gelato after dinner, it's out of this world! The atmosphere is insanely welcoming and there's a variety of flavors for everyone.
        My personal favorites are espresso and sea salted caramel, since the espresso wakes me up and there's nothing quite like having your feet in the ocean while tasting sea salt caramel. </p>

        <h3> ~San Diego~ </h3>
        <p>While my favorite parts of San Diego included kayaking at La Jolla (a beach filled with wild sea lions
          and seals) and chhering at a women's Brazil vs US soccer game, there were many fun things to do in LA too.

          <h4> ~Los Angeles~ </h4>
          <p> While the drive to LA was a little short of a nightmare, being in LA was tons of fun.  I met up with
            a few friends and went to FYF music festival.  We rented a small airbnb by Venic Beach and the world
            seemd to be ours.  Both nights at the Exposition Park were insanely fun, with tons of music and food at
            our disposal. If you love music, LA is the place to enjoy it.  We saw tons of celebrities and heard a
            mix of artists, from Missy Elliot to Hundred Waters to Frank Ocean.
