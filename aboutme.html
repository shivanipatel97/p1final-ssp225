  <p> I am currently a student at Cornell Univeristy majoring in Information Science. As much as I love Upstate New York, there is so
    much more to see in the world, whether it is a short drive away to Canada or a long plane ride over seas. Each potential
    vacation spot is unique, and every itenerary differs based on if you plan to travel with family or friends, so I'm here to share
    my experiences to hopefully give you an idea of what has worked well for me!</p>
    <p> Look through this website to read more about the fun times I had in Montreal over spring break or to see some beautiful pictures
      of the sunset during my hike in Cinque Terre. Whether it's laughing along with me on the chances that my family got a flat tire
      on an Italian highway or getting my personal opinion on the best food options in southern California, explore the site!</p>
